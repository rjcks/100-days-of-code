# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: [2021-12-31 Fri]

**Today's Progress**: Learnt how to push to github

**Thoughts:** I have started with a huge burst of optimism, but almost immediately feel /life/ intruding and anxiety & nervousness take over. There is adrenaline, which I suppose might be a sign of exitement.

### Day 1: [2022-01-01 Sat]

**Today's Progress**: Read Introduction and Chapter 1 from /Beginning Perl/; edited the Emacs::PDE templatek

**Thoughts**: Life intruded a bit today, but I guess this is a solid start.
